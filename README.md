# Java Practice Repository 🧑‍💻☕️

Welcome to my **Java Practice** repository! This project is dedicated to honing Java programming skills, starting from the basics and gradually advancing through core concepts, object-oriented principles, and a variety of data structures and algorithms.

## 🚀 About This Project

This repository is designed as a comprehensive collection of Java practice problems and solutions. It covers:

- **Basic Java Concepts:** Variables, data types, operators, control structures (loops, conditionals), and functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and more.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and other algorithmic techniques.
- **Problem Solving:** A variety of coding challenges to strengthen your logic and coding skills.
